    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Jupiter in conjunction with natal Neptune makes you a devoted, generous, ethical and spiritual person. You are enthusiastic and optimistic about becoming a better person and improving the world.

This idealistic connection allows you to understand abstract theories and integrate them into your comprehensive knowledge. Your adventurous spirit can lead to numerous trips and unique experiences.

Transcendental, religious, and mystical experiences are likely, which may lead to belief in an afterlife and reincarnation. You might want to learn about various spiritual belief systems and methods such as astrology, meditation, or alternative healing. You may also feel that you have a unique destiny or a spiritual message to share.

Jupiter in conjunction with Neptune can also make you a very controversial person associated with scandals, gossip and intrigue. You have a fantastic imagination and a willingness to believe in anything, but excessive optimism should be avoided.

Although you are more than average lucky, you should avoid gambling. The tendency to see only the positive side of any situation can lead to losses and embarrassment.</value>

This aspect can make you very strong very quickly before you have the wisdom and humility to use it safely. Before you accumulate power and wealth, you need extensive knowledge and spiritual development.

Never think that you are too smart to learn from your teachers. Before you can have power, you must submit to it. It's okay to be driven, but remember that you can't become obsessed, passionate, or complacent. You are lucky and you are able to change the world for the better and influence many people. You will become richer if you make friends along the way, not enemies.

However, when things don't go your way, you can become impatient, inflexible, or stubborn. Don't hold onto frustration and resentment, because eventually you'll lose your temper. Losing your typical low-key appearance will damage your reputation and prospects. It is better to remove any accumulation of tension through creative self-expression and controlled self-affirmation.

On the other hand, this aspect can sometimes make you too conservative. You should always believe in your abilities and trust your instincts. At your best, you are full of enthusiasm and optimism, calm, confident and disciplined.

    <value>Jupiter – Neptune. Insincere, without intention, absent-minded, promising things they can't promise. Unreliable and unrealistic if there are no other factors. There is a flaw in the signs and houses in which Jupiter and Neptune are located. In the worst case, religious arrogance, it all depends on the position of Mercury and Saturn.

There is usually a tendency towards religious mysticism and the concept of faith is distorted. Idealism does not bring people any practical benefit. They are generous and willing to help, but they lack the ability to judge. Sentimentality and excessive emotionality make others unhappy. They are vulnerable to the influence of a cult. They feel spiritually chosen. 

They dream of unusual trips. Aspects of religious pilgrimage. The danger comes from gases, fumes, drugs, alcohol. They have little practical experience and face obstacles in financial and social matters. </value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalJupiterOppositionPluto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Jupiter – Pluto. They impose their worldview on others and believe that spiritual reform is a sacred duty. Those who refuse to budge will come into conflict with them. Lust for power and money often leads to dirty tricks. They don't get recognition because of disharmony in their relationships with people. Vanity and lack of humility make them unpleasant. If they go too far in this, it will hurt them.

They rarely agree with generally accepted rules of behavior. Self-will gives them the illusion of power, but the consequences are increasingly difficult to deal with. They believe in their principles, allow exaggeration and overbearingness. At the same time, they can be adventurers or players. They constantly balance between excessive self-confidence and deep doubts. Experience has become a continuous teacher for them. They tend not to use others for personal gain.</value>

  <data name="NatalJupiterOppositionSaturn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Jupiter in opposition to Saturn leads to problems in the profession, marriage, friendship, religious field and in the team. Their serious obligations and authority depend on how they fulfill them. They often have to take on tasks that they are not yet ready to solve. Due to poor planning and time management skills, they face financial and professional difficulties. If there are no other hints, then they have little imagination. They are not flexible, tend to be conservative, and fear stagnation and monotony. Ambitious dreams come true with difficulty due to inability, failures, or lack of chances.

They rarely find satisfaction in their work, because they work only when necessary. They often have to adapt to the routine and take a subordinate position. To achieve something successfully, they have to sacrifice their personal ideals in favor of the demands of the job. No one helps them in this process. There is only one choice - either to adapt or to suffer, and by adapting, they become a narrow-minded person.

They are tongue-tied and traditional about religion. Their behavior is often hypocritical. They face obstacles on the way to higher education. Their lives are full of hardships and struggles, even when they achieve modest goals. They are prone to depression and denial of any optimism. Their parents are intolerant and tyrants. They are in real danger of encountering legal difficulties and difficulties abroad.</value>

    <value>The aspect between Jupiter and Uranus indicates an uncontrollable desire for new experiences, especially in the financial and religious spheres. Their thirst for development often requires significant investments, which can lead to financial difficulties. If this aspect is accompanied by the square of Mars, then great optimism and trustfulness are added, which can make them vulnerable to the machinations of other people. They show a high degree of idealism and good mood, but too often they base their plans on unrealistic assumptions.

They also show an interest in unusual religious cults and practices, which makes them unusual in the eyes of others. Their views on religion, upbringing, philosophy, and law often cause controversy, and they stubbornly adhere to their beliefs. They are also prone to wandering and unexpected journeys that rarely benefit them.

Inappropriate behavior with friends and lack of diplomacy can also be the cause of failures in their lives. They often become a source of constant conflict. This aspect is like a soap bubble that bursts at the lightest touch. They promise more than they can fulfill, and they may become victims of other people's manipulations.</value>

    <value>The combination of Jupiter and Neptune gives a person an extraordinary imagination and vivid perception of the world around them.

With Saturn's strong influence, people may lack initiative or trust to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. They may also make commitments without sufficient training.

These people do not handle financial speculation well and they often lose their fortunes. They are addicted to strange religions, cults, and do strange things. Many of them are mystics or adepts who live off their followers, offering salvation and help for humanity. This aspect is typical for representatives of bohemia and those who travel the world.

    <value>Jupiter - Neptune. There are mystical tendencies and sensitivity to spiritual influences. If Mercury, Saturn, and Uranus show weakness, then intuition is more emotional than mental. It attracts the splendor of ceremonies, performances, mysteries and religious music. A feeling of awe and a desire to plunge into a sea of religious ecstasy. However, they often lack true spirituality due to a lack of discernment. Without the factors of wisdom, they become victims of deception and delusion; at the same time, they are generous, hospitable, and protective of adherents of their religion and beliefs. They get help from others, even without the merit of it. They tend to be reclusive and live in rural areas, near water.

They are often engaged in charity work, taking care of religious communities and educational institutions. But they often lead a bohemian lifestyle or wander. This aspect is the most expansive and leads to unlimited fantasy. Therefore, they are better suited for religion and art than for prosaic matters. The tendency to exaggerate is a characteristic feature, as both Jupiter and Neptune have an expansive nature.

In a weak horoscope, this can lead to a parasitic lifestyle, inertia, and a desire for an easy life. However, if the personality is well developed, it can lead to inspiration, empathy, and generosity that border on sanctity.

This configuration brings wisdom, deep understanding, strong imagination and rich intelligence. She also harbors high spiritual interests and ideals. People with this configuration have good commercial skills and material wealth. However, there is a negative side - sometimes they can be detached from reality, inclined to see people in a better light, justify everyone and everything; they may not want to see the dark side of things and shroud it in darkness and mystery.</value>

    <value>Mars combined with natal Neptune makes you passionate, romantic and fascinating. You have a special aura that can fill a room and attract attention, and your strong magnetic appeal can attract people on physical, sexual, and mental levels. However, first of all, your vital spiritual energy can attract and frighten people.

You are driven by a strong faith that gives purpose to your life. You can visualize your desires and work hard to achieve your dreams. You may feel that you have a definite purpose in life or a spiritual vocation. You may have strange experiences in the spiritual world.

Following your ideals and morals and chasing your strong desires can involve you in arguments and scandals. It is very important to keep all your affairs in order and stay within the law in order to avoid slander and dishonor. You're a dreamer, but you have to remember to stay in reality from time to time.

    <value>Mars in conjunction with Pluto in the natal chart gives you a powerful desire to achieve your goals. Strength, passion and courage are your strengths, but indomitable will and a tendency to manipulation make enemies and hinder success.

Personal relationships can be unstable until you learn how to use your powerful energy. You can be very expressive and get angry quickly, but it's better to lose your temper than to let frustration, resentment, or envy accumulate inside.

Sometimes you can resort to coercion and subversive actions if you can't handle force. This dark, sinister side can be dominant, rude, nasty, and violent. You have the vitality of a warrior, and you should reserve your ruthless belligerence only for your worst enemies.

To enjoy a healthy relationship, you must transform this raw, primal energy to a higher level by helping and healing others. You can develop quickly through selfless actions, but at the same time remain ambitious and strive for the top. This aspect really contributes to success and fame, but the fewer people you have to trample to get to the top, the better.

Using your charisma, sexuality, and strength while maintaining good moral and ethical standards is the key to success. You can influence others by changing their lives, so it's important to consider the consequences, especially for weaker or more suggestible people.</value>

    <value>Mars in conjunction with natal Saturn gives you strong determination and constant efforts to achieve your goals. Your Martian desires, sexuality, and creativity are positively influenced by Saturn's discipline and strong work ethic. The dark side of Saturn can also influence your desires, but it by no means leads to negative qualities.

Sexually, this can mean tremendous stamina and maintaining sexual attractiveness and activity in later life. It also allows for intelligent exploration and expression of taboo aspects of sexuality, including pleasure and pain, dominance and submission. Traditionally, this aspect is considered to cause frustration and difficulty expressing anger and even malice. However, if you look at the maps of people with this aspect, you can see that the main theme is a healthy expression of dark desires and constant efforts leading to fruitful work in a career.

If Mars in conjunction with Saturn in the chart were in a harsh aspect or was on a restless fixed star, then we could expect the manifestation of a more heartless and malicious nature of this aspect. In this case, the key will be to find a positive energy outlet through creative efforts, and Mars really is a purposeful energy. Once the real passion in life is found, even if it's a little dark, self-discipline and determination should ensure that its manifestation is positive and productive, and not destructive to yourself or others.</value>

    <value>Mars and Jupiter: balancing waste and consideration. Outward friendliness versus selfish motives. Crusades that serve only the interests of themselves or the desire to impress. Aggressive propaganda behavior that alienates others. Arrogance, the ability to realize grandiose plans without funds.

Such behavior can be fatal for financial speculation unless a reliable partnership is found. They overestimate their own importance, not realizing the need for regular work in practice.</value>

    <value>Mars and Neptune are a combination of aggression and violence, permeated by an incomprehensible nature. The subconscious of these people is dominated by subconscious urges that are often uncontrollable. Their lives are usually full of chaos. In addition, they often hide their plans and may deceive others. However, this is not always an explicit intention, but rather an automatic reaction to the influence of the subconscious (the subconscious is associated with Neptune, the XII house and self-destruction). Their unusual sexual needs can negatively affect their marital relationships. All this leads to the search for emotional satisfaction outside the usual framework. They should avoid using drugs and alcohol, so as not to sink to a lower level of existence.

These people may suffer from neuroses related to suppressed instincts. The aspect of Mars in opposition to Neptune may indicate a strange and mysterious death, especially if there are other factors that combine the VIII, IV and XII houses. In their passion for mysticism, they can become victims of illusory visions. Their excessive emotional perception is often associated with a desire to be unusual. They are also at risk from contact with unscrupulous people who can exploit their vulnerability.

If that's the case, then eliminating this subconscious brainwashing is a top priority and a necessary task before you can enjoy a healthy relationship.

Possible connections with secret organizations, intrigues, as well as with idealists. Mediumship, occultism — everything depends on the analysis of the full horoscope. Contradictions and disharmony are possible.

Intense and sensitive susceptibility; extremism and obsession; sudden changes of mood and state; a person becomes moody; a tendency to superstitions and beliefs.

Positive aspects: deep spiritual concentration, interests in the field of spirituality, insight, frankness, honesty, directness, a tendency to selflessness.</value>

    <value>Uranus and Pluto are a powerful combination of planets that has a significant impact on the generation of people born in the 30s and living during periods of social upheaval. Wars, revolutions, and economic collapse become an integral part of their lives. But the true power of their influence on individual destiny depends on the placement of planets in corner houses and the presence of aspects with other planets and houses. Stubbornness, extravagance, radical political views and revolutionary tendencies are characteristic features of a personality influenced by Uranus and Pluto.

The mass aspect is a key factor determining the impact of social dynamics on individual development. It depends on the aspects existing between Uranus and Pluto, as well as their location in the natal chart. People affected by this influence tend to change the current social order. Their motives and ideals are high and pure, but from birth they are forced to face social difficulties, deprived of youth and carefree. Even if they were born into a wealthy family, they don't feel safe. This period of history is also associated with sexual excess, and it is important to remember this.

Uranus, which is squared with Pluto, causes fanaticism, extremism, self-will and eccentric behavior that others usually cannot understand. There is also a propensity for accidents and risk. However, on the positive side, this is an aspect that contributes to the struggle for justice and new ideas, the manifestation of fearlessness and steadfastness.</value>

  <data name="NatalUranTrineNeptune" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The aspect between Uranus and Neptune promises a high level of spirituality development. This is especially noticeable among the generation born in 1939-1945. In personal horoscopes, this aspect may not play a special role if the planets are not located in corner houses or do not form strong aspects. However, in some cases, it may indicate genius abilities. People with this aspect often show a penchant for mysticism and the occult.

People of this generation have pronounced clairvoyant abilities and developed intuition. There are a large number of astrologers, yogis, magicians and parapsychologists among them. They tend to join similar societies to develop their skills. They also have utopian ideals and their destiny is to raise the level of spirituality of the entire civilization to a new height.

This aspect will give you unique abilities, intuition and strong psychological insight. It's not surprising if you have clairvoyance and even telepathy. Your premonitions and prophetic dreams delight others. You have a deep interest in parapsychology and are highly receptive. However, keep in mind that there is some danger that you may break away from reality and "fly into the clouds."</value>

    <value>A generation with a strong will to transform civilization and carry out reforms. A burning passion for science and the occult. They symbolize progress and political change by applying their knowledge in science and the occult. They do not tolerate opposition and obstacles to progress. Thus, through collective efforts, new forms of civilization are being formed and new sources of energy are being discovered, while simultaneously developing intuitive abilities. However, not everyone feels this effect, unless the planets are in significant positions in the sky and are enhanced through aspects.

Originality, enterprise, constructiveness, determination, insight, frankness, honesty, directness. The disadvantage is the ability to channel ingenuity for personal gain.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusConjunctionJupiter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The conjunction of Venus with Jupiter in the natal chart reflects how this location looks in the sky, beautiful and charming. When two of the most beautiful planets meet together, they become the most attractive and popular attractions. Your popularity is due not only to your physical attractiveness, but also to your sincere warm and friendly nature. Your presence encourages others to show the same warmth and affection that you naturally radiate.

This is one of the safest planetary aspects. You dislike conflict to the extent that you can promote peace by setting an example of generosity and harmony. It's not that you are particularly active in dispute resolution, as this will require unpleasant arguments and negotiations.

Your aversion to aggression or threatening situations means that you prefer to be among pleasant people and live in a beautiful environment. You are not a picky freak, but enjoy beauty in all its forms. You may have a talent for art, music, or poetry, or you may manifest these qualities as pure enjoyment of beauty, entertainment, and relaxation.

The conjunction of Venus with Jupiter is a good omen for your social and personal life, because you attract pleasant things. Since Venus manages money as well as love, you probably won't have to struggle like most others to live a life of comfort or even luxury. However, you are also very generous and may not have the strong desire and determination to get on the rich list.

Depending on other complex aspects of this connection or the location of the fixed stars, this very positive aspect may have some negative sides. Self-control and extravagance can become a problem leading to addiction or greed. It may be difficult for you to find motivation, and you prefer to be content with the blessings that your good karma brings into this life.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusConjunctionMars" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The conjunction of Venus with natal Mars has a profound effect on relationships, but your intense passions can affect all areas of life. Your strong desire for love and affection means that loving relationships take up a lot of your time. Your sexual attraction and need for intimacy can sometimes cause friction in a relationship.

Your intensity level may be too much for your partner to handle, and people with Venus in conjunction with Mars often have many marriages or affairs. Finding a new partner is not difficult due to your high sexuality and magnetic attraction. Flirting will be the most enjoyable activity, but you need to be aware of the impact of this flirting on your existing partner in order to maintain a long-term relationship.

The ability to attract other people means that you must be popular on social media and with the public at large. Such a public appeal often helps in your career and is one of the reasons why you can count on financial well-being or at least comfort.

Another advantage of your career is your intense single-minded energy. A strong work ethic and creative enthusiasm can lead to significant achievements and widespread recognition of your achievements.

Speaking about the conjunction of Venus with Mars, astrologers Robert Hand and Robert Pelletier suggest that how you treat the opposite sex largely depends on your relationship with a parent of the opposite sex in your youth.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusConjunctionNeptune" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus combined with natal Neptune makes you a romantic, an idealist and a dreamer. You can easily fall head over heels in love with someone, and your empathy and compassion can only be admired.

However, this tendency towards romantic love can make you vulnerable to heartbreak and disappointment. Other people who aren't as caring as you are may see your kindness as a weakness and take advantage of you.

You should expect others to reciprocate and be faithful to you in order to maintain equal rights in a loving relationship. Once you overcome the tendency to overly idealize or subconsciously ignore the other person's negative traits, you will reduce the risk of dissolution or grief.

The conjunction of Venus with Neptune also suggests that you must have musical, artistic, or other creative talents. You can appreciate the surreal, and shaping the more intangible impressions you receive will have a therapeutic effect.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusConjunctionPluto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The conjunction of Venus with natal Pluto creates an intense love nature. How you need to love and be loved manifests itself positively or negatively, largely depending on other aspects and fixed stars in your chart. The variability of the expression of love in this union is mainly due to the way you love yourself.

In any case, relationships are a serious issue in your life and vital to your well—being. It will be easier for you than most to attract a partner because of your level of attraction, both emotional and sexual. Instant attraction, karmic relationships, and falling head over heels can relate to you or your loved ones. It won't take long for you to fall deeply in love and form a strong alliance.

If other factors in your chart indicate low self-esteem or a bad mood, the conjunction of Venus with Pluto can lead to a lack of self-love and a destructive relationship. You can become a victim of betrayal or abuse, experiencing intense pain every time you are stung. And it can be a repetitive cycle leading to despair.

Jealousy, possessiveness, manipulation, and even crimes can lead to shame and embarrassment. Negative manifestations can also lead to drug abuse or other forms of self-harm. Poverty, sadomasochism, sexual violence, and rape can be extreme examples.

Even in the depths of Pluto's realm, you can always use the powerful ability to overcome pain and change your life. Perhaps fate will see that you visit the darkness, because you are reborn like a butterfly from a cocoon.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusConjunctionSaturn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The conjunction of Venus with natal Saturn makes you a very devoted and caring person, but you may have trouble showing it. This can lead to delay and restraint in forming close relationships. You crave love and affection, but there are many obstacles on the way to this. Life will give you a painful experience to learn to love yourself and others.

This may be a karmic aspect. People from previous lives who felt betrayed or offended by you will look for you in this life to teach you a lesson and balance the situation. It is also possible that people who have hurt you in previous incarnations will return with love and valuable lessons to teach. Once you reach a certain point of evolution, difficulties and grief will give way to loving and lasting relationships.

The conjunction of Venus with Saturn can be the most difficult during adulthood. Lack of self-love or self-respect is usually the main reason for shyness or inability to maintain close relationships. It would be much worse if your parents or teachers were strict with you. You may have experienced deprivation, meanness, lack of love and affection, or lack of attention, especially from your father. Abuse is also possible, but the main thing is that you may have felt unloved and unappreciated by others.

Rejection, isolation, and loneliness add to these difficulties as you miss out on opportunities to develop social and personal interaction skills. Social awkwardness is likely, and you will most likely prefer to communicate with only one person or with a minimum number of people at any one time.

The more you treat yourself badly, the more people will avoid you. Imagine that you are wearing a sign around your neck that says "I am a freak." Your karmic lesson in this life is to love yourself so that others can love you. You can experience periods of isolation between relationships, and breakups and divorces are common for this aspect.</value>

    <value>The conjunction of Venus with natal Uranus stimulates your social and love life, but it's a variable situation. Much will depend on the respective planetary aspects or the conjunction of the fixed stars. Under the favorable influence, the conjunction of Venus and Uranus can bring exciting romances with enough personal freedom to enjoy a glamorous social life. However, a large number of squares or oppositions to this arrangement can lead to instability in your personal life and sudden financial losses.

In any case, maintaining an open mind and flexibility is crucial to achieve the best results in this aspect. Change is a big part of your life, especially when it comes to love and money. It is important to note that this is closely related to how you feel about yourself or the level of your self-love.

In these areas of life, you need to have sharp instincts to reasonably anticipate changes, especially with experience as you get older. This can manifest itself in the fact that we are one step ahead in fashion or social trends. Otherwise, you will most likely stand out from the crowd or change again as soon as everyone catches up with you.

You can fall in love at first sight and be guided by your intuition in matters of love and finances — this is normal. However, always be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances, which is especially important when you feel that your individuality and freedom are under threat.

If you want a long-term commitment in love, you're probably better off finding a partner who also values their freedom. And, like you, they may be unusual in some way, such as belonging to a different cultural or ethnic background.

Online dating may be suitable for you, but it may require some distance, requiring air travel. Or perhaps your social and personal life can be stimulated by air travel. Other ways to keep up the excitement in a relationship can be surprises and perversity during gymnastics in the bedroom naked.

This aspect is known for generating a certain degree of genius in terms of creative talent. Whatever you do as a hobby or professionally, you will develop your own unique style and you will need some creative freedom if you work in large groups. Although some may be shocked by your creative expression, on a deeper level you seek to reveal or enlighten your progressive and futuristic vision.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusOppositionJupiter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus, in opposition to natal Jupiter, gives a happy and loving personality with an appropriate appearance. Popularity and social success are likely, and you should have no problem making friends or finding a partner. However, problems can arise deeper, regarding the dynamics of relationships and success in life.

Being such a receptive and pleasant person, it can be difficult to take a firm stand. In a loving relationship, this can cause disrespect from the other person as they try to dominate you or use you. It may be difficult for you to find the motivation to work hard to achieve your goals at a professional level.

Such problems will get worse the more serious or conservative the other person is, or the more responsibility and discipline your career requires. You don't like being bound by time frames, commitments, or routines, and such things prevent you from enjoying life at your own pace.

Venus in opposition to Jupiter makes you a free spirit, and your presence encourages others to enjoy life every day without regrets. It would be better if you didn't try to change this cheerful attitude and your attachment level was positive. However, this can often mean that you are missing out on certain areas of life that give deeper meaning or a sense of achievement.

You must find a profession that matches your creativity and love of pleasure. A career that brings a sense of stability, respect, recognition, and even authority will balance what can be seen as an aversion to hard work and responsibility.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusOppositionMars" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in opposition to Mars in the natal chart creates an intense emotional life leading to an equally violent relationship. When you love someone, you express your strong feelings through deeply passionate and sometimes dramatic displays of affection. Although this is normal for you and is a sign of how much you love someone, the other person may think that you are being too persistent and feel threatened.

An energetic and not too submissive partner who matches your passions is best suited for you. Probably, even with such a partner, you will still have a stormy relationship. The positive thing is that you calm down as quickly as you let off steam. The way you show affection directly can be your advantage, because you put as much effort into reconciliation as into exacerbating any small irritation.

Venus in opposition to Mars is a very physical planetary aspect, and your high energy needs other forms of release besides sex. Intense internal conflict between love and hate can lead to the emergence of a special creative style, expressed in sports, entertainment, art, music and dancing. The dynamic physicality of this aspect may even manifest itself in characteristic or exaggerated facial features or pronounced body musculature.</value>

    <value>Venus in opposition to natal Neptune creates a struggle to get what you most want: romance, harmony, and maybe a little glamour and luxury. These things are achievable, but there is a lot of work to be done to overcome disappointment and dissolution in love and money.

You may suffer from low self-esteem, especially at a young age. You may be afraid that you are not worthy enough to have a loving and caring partner who loves you for who you are. You can make significant sacrifices to keep your ideal partner and end up feeling unhappy or used. You may also fantasize about your partner or overly idealize him, and then feel upset when he doesn't meet your expectations.

Such disappointment in personal life stems from the same problems as any financial loss, for example, due to deception or blind investment in questionable schemes. Serious problems with Venus in opposition to Neptune begin with your self-esteem. Working hard on how you love yourself is crucial to achieving your dreams. Neptune rules the stage, the screen, the mirrors, the ocean, and spirituality. They give tips on how to increase the amount of self-love.

You can find deeper self-love through a more spiritual approach to life. Perhaps undressing in front of a mirror or webcam gives you the necessary self-confidence. Dancing, music, surfing, or swimming are activities that promote self—love and joy. You can try decorating your body with jewelry or tattoos, or pay special attention to fashion and cosmetics. Decorating your home or workplace will replace the illusions and fears of Neptune with natural beauty.</value>

    <value>Venus in opposition to Pluto in the natal chart provides instant attraction and intense relationships. You are very attracted to specific people; others may feel the same irresistible attraction to you. There is something mysterious about this karmic attraction that you cannot explain, and sometimes it is associated with dark or even dangerous desires.

Sometimes you and your friends and partners are likely to experience overwhelming feelings of jealousy or possessiveness. This is to be expected because of your strong feelings of love. Suspicions can get out of control and you will feel threatened. It is very important not to react to such out-of-control emotions by manipulating others or using dirty tricks; such behavior will backfire or eventually catch up with you.

You have enough magnetic power not to force someone to love you. Someone who matches your high level of passion will come. An ideal relationship would be one in which power would be shared and none of you would feel intimidated.

Thanks to your close one-on-one relationship, you will learn not to hold on so tightly. It may take a few dramatic and painful experiences before you realize that trying to control others ends up destroying relationships.

It is equally important not to allow yourself to be manipulated. If you are the more submissive type, then you are at greater risk of being taken advantage of, used, and insulted. In extreme cases, this can lead to domestic violence and rape.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusOppositionSaturn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in opposition to natal Saturn makes it extremely difficult to form a love relationship. You would immediately realize that you are not suitable because of your below-average social skills. Not understanding why you have a feeling of worthlessness or inadequacy. Thinking that something was wrong with you made you feel guilty, which may have been reinforced by the lack of affection, criticism, or ostracism from your parents and other adults, especially authority figures such as teachers.

One or both parents may have lacked parenting skills related to positive reinforcement, or in the worst case were angry and violent. You have to teach yourself about love and money, because it's valuable. Anyway, your early conditioning made you believe that you weren't that good and deserved to be sad and lonely. There may be some karmic reasons for this, but that's in the past, and the corrective actions are the same.

Therefore, perhaps, before you learn to love yourself, you will have to understand that you are not a bad person. Saturn blooms late, so you've probably experienced delays, limitations, and difficulties in adulthood. Acknowledging and acknowledging that your problems are caused by an inferiority complex is half the case won. You can fix a lot if you don't have to blame or forgive all the people who were mean or rejected you.

It is very important to get rid of feelings of guilt and self-pity. Forgive yourself for everything you think you did, and it was so bad. Imagine that you are wearing a sign that says: "I'm useless; go away." Now throw it as far as you can. Delete the old message and get ready for the next step.

Learn to love and appreciate yourself. Speak to yourself verbally and recite mantras at night or in front of a mirror. You have to reprogram your brain. By this point, you will begin to show more confident energy and notice that your relationship is starting to improve. You will see a closer bond, more caring and mutual help. You will discover true love and enjoyment.

If necessary, you can go even further and convince yourself that you deserve love and money because of your hard work on personal development. You might be surprised how quickly you attract love and money if you truly believe you deserve it.

With age comes great satisfaction, as well as respect and recognition for your achievements.</value>

    <value>Venus in opposition to Uranus in the natal chart provides an extraordinary love life. You need a lot of stimulation and excitement in a relationship, but you also need to feel free enough to be yourself, which can create commitment issues. Growing up, you may have discovered that lasting friendships require a lot of effort. It would be easier to create a solid company with someone who also needs a fair amount of personal freedom.

Strong and stable love relationships are still possible with Venus in opposition to Uranus. There are two options: find someone unusual who will stimulate you, or find another free spirit willing to make commitments. Whatever you want in love, you can expect a lot of instability or unrest. The more you promote change and excitement in a relationship, the less likely it is that some kind of upsetting external event will lead to chaos.

Your need for stimulation and excitement in love may find another safe outlet. You can experiment with your sexuality, especially if heterosexual relationships limit you. In addition, there are endless possibilities for arousal and stimulation in the bedroom, which will help you become interested and prolong the life of the relationship.

You may need to take a more conservative approach to your finances. Your bank balance may fluctuate dramatically. Saving or keeping some routine budget will be important to reduce the risk of unforeseen events that will leave you in debt.</value>

Relationships are most important to you because you need friendships and romance. You may enjoy flirting, but you can also hide your personal life. Marriage may be necessary, and you expect the same commitment and dedication as you do. Although this aspect involves tenderness, affection, and caring, you are also very passionate and sexual, sometimes even obscene.

The only drawback of this aspect will be associated with excessive pampering. This can affect the diet, especially with regard to sugar, but it can also cause problems with addictions that can spiral out of control and lead to self-destruction.

When I say that you are passionate about love, you feel it deeply enveloping you; you can even define yourself through a strong relationship or love for something. It's an overall positive influence that has a positive effect on your relationship.

The term "love to death" may apply to you, but you will find that almost everyone would like you to love them. Even if it sometimes feels like you're getting too tense or too strong, it's only because you're very concerned about a particular problem. For example, you may become persistent if you believe your partner is in danger.

Friendship is the most important thing for you. You are incredibly loyal and dedicated and expect the same in return. But even you will realize that only a rare person can match you in the level of devotion you show to another.

You will be happy with a partner who will not be demanding and suffocating, who may have an unconventional family lifestyle or who will have to combine many obligations.

    <value>Venus squared with natal Jupiter makes you a lucky, creative and cheerful person. This must be the best of all the difficult aspects of the square in astrology. There are a number of related difficulties, but they are usually relatively easy to overcome.

Your optimistic outlook on life, generosity, and all-round charming good nature make you a pleasant person, and you should be popular with little difficulty in making friends. The tension that exists inside you is a good motivator for creativity. This aspect favors all kinds of art, including drama, comedy, music, writing, painting, and sculpture. Your sense of humor will border on the cheeky.

Venus squared with Jupiter can cause problems with motivation in relation to daily chores and monotonous hard work to generate income. Lack of self-discipline can cause difficulties at work and in fulfilling other serious responsibilities and responsibilities in life. This is especially true if you have a family. Your charisma will help you avoid the heavy responsibilities of parenting.

Other people may consider that you have questionable or "loose" moral principles. Most likely, this will cause problems in your personal life, and lowering your standards will lead to complications or embarrassment. Or perhaps the obligations in a relationship like marriage are causing anxiety. Sometimes a careless attitude can annoy your partner, or you may get the impression that you don't care or aren't bothered.

However, as mentioned earlier, eliminating any weaknesses that add friction to your relationship won't take much effort. The same applies to your finances. You may find it difficult to find enough money to maintain your desired lifestyle. The luxuries of entertainment, entertainment, and holidays may require you to take a more responsible position in your career.

    <value>Venus squared with natal Mars brings strong feelings of love and hate into an incredibly intimate relationship. Any irritation with loved ones can quickly turn into anger and tantrums. However, this intensity of feelings subsides as quickly as it increases as soon as the pressure valve is released.

Thus, the lesson of the square of Venus with Mars is to learn how to better control volatile passions. Work through them maturely with your loved ones. An open and honest exchange of these deep feelings will help achieve the strongest desire, usually a stable, harmonious and long-lasting relationship.

Any difficulties in bridging the gap between love and hate would be even worse if conflict arose between adult parents. An understanding but not weak or submissive partner will help transform aggressive or violent tendencies into a sexually attractive and extremely passionate nature. Physically creating things can also be useful for relieving the stress of this aspect and developing a talent for sculpture, for example, in a competitive sport. Practicing in small groups, especially at a young age, will help you gain self-confidence in social situations.</value>

    <value>Venus squared with Neptune in the natal chart creates difficulties with loving oneself and others, which leads to low self-esteem and disappointment in love without corrective action. Self-love is essential for a healthy and loving relationship. Therefore, learning to love yourself is vital to address this difficult aspect.

This aspect is familiar to a person when they feel unloved, unattractive, victimized, and ostracized. You may think that you are too different or strange in the eyes of others and are not accepted by the crowd. It is very important to understand that what you think others think of you may not be accurate. If there were any truth in this perception, it would be mainly due to the signals you send about yourself.

Once you realize that Neptune distorts your self-image, you can improve your attitude towards yourself. Since Neptune controls mirrors, movies, and screens, a great way to increase self—love is to repeat positive affirmations in front of the mirror. Since Venus rules beauty, improving your appearance through cosmetics and fashion may be worthwhile. Show off in front of the mirror, take a selfie, even take a video of yourself and see how beautiful you are. Dance a little, be sexy, and even undress. No one should see... unless you want to.

Once you love yourself inside and out, you will find that your personal life and other areas will improve. However, it is also possible that Neptune may distort your assessment of other people. There will be a tendency to overly idealize romantic partners, being blind to their shortcomings. This will make you susceptible to significant disappointment, you will be taken advantage of, you will become someone's doormat or even a sex slave.

Another serious danger of solving the problem of self—esteem is self-abuse. The opposite of love is hate; hating oneself will lead to a downward spiral of self-harm. This includes an unhealthy diet leading to either obesity or anorexia. Depression is an important cause of addiction to alcohol and other toxic drugs or medications.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusSquarePluto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The quadrature of Venus with natal Pluto complicates your intimate relationship due to the intensity of your feelings. Not your general mood and feelings, but how you feel and show love and affection. This intensity can manifest itself as infatuation or harassment when you are attracted to someone. You just fall deeply in love, but sometimes your behavior can be threatening or domineering to others, especially when you're young.

With age comes the ability to hide the most negative behavior. But to achieve true mutual love, you must transform, not hide, this destructive behavior. This negative behavior is mainly aimed at gaining complete control over the relationship so that you don't have to feel insecure or worry that it might end. Thus, the square of Venus and Pluto can lead to manipulative behaviors such as jealousy, guilt, or possessiveness.

Using your power to make someone love you will eventually end in a breakup, which, of course, will be extremely painful and dramatic for you. But it's only through such an intense relationship that you become aware of your manipulative or controlling behavior. Then you can use your immense power to positively change the way you give and receive love. This process can be painful because you will realize that loving yourself is a real problem. Once you learn to love yourself, the unconditional love and approval you seek will be at your fingertips.

Before you realize the need for self-love, you may be attracted to dangerous partners or those who treat you badly. Perhaps you subconsciously attract such people because of your poor self-esteem.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusSquareSaturn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Venus-Saturn quadrature in the natal chart is one of the most difficult aspects. The two most important things in life are love and happiness, which seem even more important to you because they are more difficult to achieve than others. You will often feel like you are being denied what you most want. This aspect was associated with laziness, immorality, shamelessness, bad habits, perverted tastes, meanness, seduction, and sadness in love.

Feelings of rejection, isolation, and loneliness can arise early. How you deal with this throughout your life largely depends on how much love you receive from your parents, especially your father. You would need encouragement and support to boost your self-esteem and love. If you were criticized or insulted, this aspect would be more severe in adulthood, which would lead to bouts of depression.

Although the square aspects are difficult, they provide ample opportunities to eliminate your weaknesses. Constant challenges and lessons in self-esteem and love mean that as you age, you will be able to achieve the long-term happiness you seek.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusSquareUran" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The square of Venus and natal Uranus provides an exciting love life. Problems related to commitment in a close relationship can be caused by a strong need for personal independence. You are not bound by the traditional social or moral standards of marriage and intimate relationships.

Not only this need for freedom, but also the need for stimulation and arousal can cause sudden attraction, volatile attachments, and instability in your relationship. Inspiration and excitement go hand in hand with change, Uranus' main keyword. According to the American writer Toni Morrison:

In order to be as free as possible, in my own imagination I cannot take closed positions.

Although if we talk about her attitude to feminism, this need for freedom mainly affects love relationships, but also concerns your values and beliefs. Venus governs love, money, and how you rate yourself. You must express the spontaneous, electric nature of Uranus in order to maintain healthy self-esteem or truly love yourself.

At first, you can try to meet or meet the expectations of your family and friends. However, boring friends or a boring lover can interfere with your style. You don't like being tied up or suffocated by love. The continuation of such a relationship will be the result or cause of poor self-esteem. You could react by lashing out or doing something unexpected, like having a secret affair or packing up and walking out the door.

However, there is a trade-off between living alone and an unhappy relationship. Although you don't want to attract disloyal or overly eccentric partners, you can find someone open, unorthodox, or interesting like yourself.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusTrineJupiter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in trine with natal Jupiter is one of the best planetary aspects. Without the harsh aspects affecting this trigon, you can look forward to an easy and comfortable life earned by previous incarnations of loving service. Even though there are difficult aspects involved, Venus in trine to Jupiter will reduce difficulties and bring love and joy into your life.

Your ease in showing love and affection shows your self-love and self-respect. Honesty, loyalty and good moral qualities are more personal qualities that will bring you popularity and a good name. However, you are not just a gentle and pleasant person.

There is genuine depth to your charismatic appeal. Your enterprising and creative nature makes your communication interesting and engaging. You sincerely help others and would be very happy to work for charities. You will fit perfectly into any group of people and will be able to effectively contribute to the overall success in achieving common goals. It may not be as obvious as taking on the role of a leader, but all the little things you do bring victory.

Creativity is a strong point, and you must have a good sense of rhythm and tone. People with this aspect often have broad musical or other creative talents. For example, as a singer, you are likely to have a wide vocal range.

You like holidays and parties in general. Exposing yourself and being glamorous is natural and shouldn't harm your reputation. Excessive passion for food, drink and drugs can sometimes be a problem, but usually there are other, more complex aspects or fixed stars in your chart that disrupt the harmonious nature of this aspect.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusTrineMars" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in a trine with Mars in the natal chart gives passion for life and social popularity. Your balanced nature allows you to enjoy life to the fullest without harnessing the energy of others. People like being around you because you like sharing your true self. There are no secrets or hidden intentions here that others might worry about. You're comfortable being yourself in any situation, and you won't have any problems making real friends.

Without trying, you entertain people simply because of your playful and youthful nature. You may have a lot of friends, but in a closer relationship you are more likely to prefer a long-term partnership where loyalty is important. When you grow up, you may have many lovers, but devotion will bring you the most satisfaction and contentment in life.

Although you are very passionate and charismatic, the overtly sexual nature of Mars is not as strong here as in other aspects of Venus-Mars. The harmonious nature of Trigon allows the softer nature of Venus to manifest itself more strongly than in related aspects. Venus and the trine aspect are related to each other. Thus, although you may be a sexy person, you are less likely to flaunt this quality and will care more about showing love and affection, as well as appreciating beauty.

On the other hand, this aspect tends to highlight your creative talents more than other aspects of Venus-Mars. You can show your creativity in all areas of life, from your lively nature to your hobbies and career. Art, drama and music are not the only professions in which you can show your creative potential.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusTrineNeptune" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in trine with Neptune in the natal chart affects two main areas of life: your relationships and creative expression. Of course, both stem from your inner nature, which is genuinely friendly and compassionate. Peace and tranquility are your ideals, and you want everything in your world to be beautiful and meet your spiritual goals.

Your personal life is important to you; tenderness and affection are at the center of attention. You are a gentle and warm person, and you will not like aggressive, domineering, or selfish partners. You're likely to idealize lovers or potential lovers, so there's a chance you'll be disappointed if they don't live up to your lofty ideals and repay you with a universal, unconditional style of love.

If other, more important aspects do not indicate sexuality and physicality in your chart, you may prefer soft caresses and hugs to an unrestrained sex life. As I have already said, communication on an emotional and spiritual level will bring you the greatest satisfaction in a relationship. I expect that privacy may also concern you.

Your surrealistic view of the world and artistic creativity are conducive to working in art. You should have a beautiful voice and possibly a high vocal range. Think of Ariana Grande, who has Venus in a trine with Neptune located under a sphere of one degree. If you had to perform in front of others, you would have a presence on a magnetic screen, and such a career would match your fabulous idealism.

But there are many other activities that suit your inclinations. You should be interested in defending the rights of others or providing some kind of service. You can participate in charities or humane societies. You are probably more inclined towards the progressive or socialist side of politics.</value>

  <data name="NatalVenusTrinePluto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in trine with Pluto in the natal chart adds depth and intensity to your feelings and everything you love or are passionate about. Overall, this is a positive aspect, but it also has a dark side. The main impact will have on your personal life and other close relationships. It's easy for you to fall deeply in love, and you take relationships very seriously.

In a new relationship, your depth of feelings, care, and passion make you feel deeply intertwined. Your devotion and interest in another person may be too much for them, and any rejection will be very painful for you. Therefore, you should seek relationships with people who are also deep and serious people.

The depth of feelings caused by the trigon of Venus and Pluto can make you explore and question the dynamics of relationships and even love itself. This leads to a psychological evolution or transformation that can continue your life. This inner growth that you are experiencing can lead to a distance between you and your partner.

Another effect on a relationship is that you may marry someone powerful, influential, or famous and find yourself involved in a difficult relationship or affair. Although such things may seem negative, you need such an intense experience that is vital to your evolution.

Life in general can include arguments and scandals related to things that you like. But again, such things will be useful to you in the long run. You have such deep needs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusTrineSaturn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in trine with Saturn in the natal chart gives conservative values and unwavering loyalty. Commitment to relationships and family values is fundamental, but you shouldn't push your respect for traditions to the extreme. Your feelings are well regulated, and although you are not an extrovert, you should not be overly shy.

You are well-mannered and tactful in communication, but you may prefer small groups. You're probably most comfortable in one-on-one situations where you'll be more open about sharing your love and affection. Perhaps you don't like flirting and one-night stands, which may affect a shorter list of lovers than the average.

Nevertheless, you have a good chance of finding true love, and your mutual friendships will have a strong karmic bond. New relationships may be slow to form, but they will have a solid foundation, will be faithful and long-lasting. You may prefer someone with a more reasonable attitude, such as yourself, or someone from a different generation. But sometimes opposites attract, and it always depends on your fate.

Partners and friends may be connected by practical considerations or shared responsibilities such as work or hobbies. Despite your seriousness, you may have a dark or mischievous sense of humor and enjoy pranks. Venus in a trine with Saturn will not hinder your creativity and artistic expression, but will give it structure and form.

As in your personal life, you are reliable and loyal in your career, showing respect to your elders and superiors. Your strong work ethic and productivity will earn the respect of your superiors and serve you well in your career advancement. You would succeed in a traditional business with little or no risk, such as real estate, as well as manufacturing or selling jewelry, fashion, or cosmetics.

You may not be extravagant and don't expect instant success, but you can expect to be rewarded for hard work. Perhaps you know how to save money and successfully invest in real estate, art, jewelry, or even blue-chip stocks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="NatalVenusTrineUran" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Venus in trine with Uranus in the natal chart gives an interesting and unique personality. You need to be around people; therefore, communication is very important. The need for stimulation applies to your social life and, most importantly, to your personal life. Although you may want a long-term commitment, you should feel free and not suffocated.

If you can find a strange or stimulating partner, you can settle down. On the other hand, you would also be happy with an open-minded partner who would allow you to communicate widely without feeling jealous.

Venus in a trine with Uranus can bring unique or unusual friends. You can change friends as your affections are constantly evolving. You expect the same from your friends and don't demand constant time and attention from them. And friends will be easy to find thanks to your popularity and playful nature. You can easily hold the attention of a group of people thanks to your stimulating and engaging social skills.

You love everything new, such as technology, and want to keep up to date with the latest inventions. The same love applies to beautiful things, and your original creative talents can lead to groundbreaking work. A combination of creative talent and experimentation can lead to a career in science as well as in art.</value>

  <data name="TransitJupiterConjunctionMercury" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This is a great period of thought when our mind is stimulated and we are ready, attuned, and eager to learn; in fact, we crave new knowledge! The bigger the idea and the broader the concept, the more receptive we are to it. Mental stress has never been so pleasant.

How big is the universe? This is a good time to explore the height, depth, and facets of any object. We respond to new information and can even be teachers or mentors ourselves during this period. Now we speak quite convincingly, inspiring others, but we can overdo it in our preaching behavior. We can also exaggerate, talk too much or loudly, or be overly confident in our ideas. And the problem with knowing all this is that then we won't be able to learn anything! Trying to stay humble will help us formulate our big plans for the future.

The conjunction of transit Jupiter with natal Mercury has the same meaning as transit Mercury in conjunction with natal Jupiter, but it lasts much longer and indicates a long period of mental development, harmonious communication, intellectual and cultural enrichment. It is characterized by increased interest in religion, philosophy, and education, and is especially favorable to teachers, lawyers, lecturers, writers, students, reporters, ministers, and commentators.

  <data name="TransitJupiterConjunctionMoon" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our mood rises when the Moon visits Jupiter monthly. No matter how bad things may seem, we are looking into a future in which life seems a little better and brighter. Although this influence is very fleeting, it can be an inspiration to support us. We feel refreshed, optimistic, and even lucky. Any emotions we experience can suddenly intensify at this time.

Our concern extends beyond the personal to a broad social level; we want to contribute and improve conditions for everyone. Training or mentoring is going well now, as are family matters, because we are sensitive to each other and willing to listen.

The conjunction of the transiting Jupiter with the radical Moon has the same significance as the transiting Moon in conjunction with the natal Jupiter, but lasts longer.

Associations with hospitals, orphanages, universities, or other religious and cultural organizations may benefit. There is a tendency towards generosity and kindness towards family members.

There is a strong desire for long-distance travel, especially for the purpose of religious pilgrimage and the study of foreign cultures. Many people feel the urge to escape from the dull hustle and bustle of their daily routine.

This is a great time to make an announcement or broadcast yourself or a project you're working on.

There's no better time to travel, especially to a place we've never been to, so plan a trip abroad. If this is impractical, have lunch at an international restaurant. The whole idea is to expand our horizons and do things that we don't normally do.

This period is unfavorable for risky and competitive sports, for the typical aspects of long-distance travel and relationships with men. Legal actions or other maneuvers may interfere with the physical implementation of your plans or the achievement of your goals. Anyway, there's going to be a shift in your business these days.

There may be a lack of practicality in applying religious and spiritual ideals.

In some cases, there is an inflated sense of cultural and spiritual significance. It can take the form of proper humility or a status that replaces that achieved by following certain spiritual teachers or becoming involved in a religious sect.

Some show whiny sentimentality and wrong sympathies. They tend to nod at "son of a bitch" stories and unworthy calls for help. Those who gain trust and propose plans for "lightning enrichment" should be avoided, as they may turn out to be self-destructive factors.

During this transit, in order to keep up with reality, practical discipline is needed. Subconscious distortions and neurotic escapist tendencies may surface.

    <value>Circumstances are unlikely to contribute to your prosperity. There may be situations that will exhaust your maximum resources, at this time, you will show generosity towards those who do not need it, or you will make futile efforts. Those who could help you will be powerless or unwittingly lead you down the wrong path. Those who approach you with grandiose plans or the promise of successful businesses will not be able to keep their promises, no matter how good their intentions may be. Of course, this is not to say that you will be deprived of a choice in these matters.

Conservative views will keep you from overreacting in one way or another.

Your maturity will have a positive impact on your behavior and the outcome of your actions, especially if you are annoyed by the lack of progress and constant clashes with those who misinterpret your methods and goals. During this period, your physical energy, aspirations, and relationships with men may be positively or negatively affected, depending on other factors caused by the current circumstances of your life.

Deception or confusion may hinder your efforts, you will not receive recognition, your actions will not lead to any changes (at least in your opinion) or will not have a lasting impact. In turn, this will deprive you of any desire to make any efforts, you may get carried away with unprofitable or unrealistic enterprises. During this period, your work will lead to success thanks to the inspiration of intuition, sensitivity or spirituality that you put into it. Even if your actions do not achieve the intended goal, their result may be no less successful or significant. Your job or the men in your life during this period may be related to the ocean, the fishing industry, shoes, photography, dancing, drugs, alcohol, fraud, bankruptcy, charities, and the correctional system.

    <value>At this time, clear and rational thinking becomes difficult. The positive and negative potentials of this period influence your worldview, the ways of self-expression, the ideas you perceive or generate, the information you disseminate and receive, the invention and application of new methods.

Positive potential provides an opportunity to develop technical, design and communication skills, as well as imagination, spirituality, intuition and a higher level of thinking. All this can be successfully applied in the fields of education, computers, linguistics, information systems, publishing, distribution of periodicals and other literature, travel, transport, advertising, radio broadcasting, communication systems and equipment, trade and commercial enterprises.

Negative potential introduces confusion and disorganization, generates a lack of attention to detail, mental laziness, detachment from reality, and obvious deception. During this period, it will be difficult for you to effectively follow schedules, plan work, and complete it on time. Events related to neighbors, brothers, sisters, colleagues and fellow travelers can create chaos, strange or mysterious incidents, but at the same time cause a surge of inspiration and spirituality.

    <value>With this astrological stop, you will experience a feeling of detachment from the roots, inability to make serious emotional commitments towards others, as well as the inability to force them to make similar commitments towards you. Depending on the specific situation, relationships in the family, with relatives, and especially with the mother may disintegrate or become even stronger, filled with new spiritual content. There may be some mystery or confusion related to your family or your past. During this period, you are not able to determine exactly what you are striving for and what you really need.

This can encourage you to daydream-even if you've never had a penchant for baseless fantasies. At the same time, your creative inclinations and spirituality will increase, and your intuition will develop noticeably. Trying to follow the usual business routine will prove difficult even under the most favorable circumstances. Keep a close eye on your property, as theft or loss is very likely during this period due to your own negligence. Do not forget about the troubles that threaten you, and direct your efforts to take advantage of the positive potential.

Transit does not occur during a person's normal life, with the exception of early childhood, during the retrograde and forward motion of Neptune. In this case, forces beyond the control of the infant and his family may threaten or change the course of his future.

    <value>This transit is characterized by the exploration of the subconscious mind and, in some cases, seemingly supernatural or miraculous phenomena. This period can stimulate latent occult and intuitive abilities and lead to intuitive, clairvoyant, or mystical experiences that alter the level of awareness. Some act as channels for spiritual inspiration and wisdom. In extreme cases, they are trained, witnessed, or subjected to out-of-body experiences, telepathy, premonitions, or memories of past lives. There may be other extraordinary events, for example, you can see UFOs. Transit leads to the need to regenerate the subconscious, to give up old, worn-out emotional attitudes and clues by exploring one's own thoughts and consciously tracing them back to their origin and origin. Important changes in life and personal affairs can be caused by large-scale economic, political, environmental, or cultural forces. Strange and mysterious circumstances can affect combined finances, corporate business, insurance, taxes, inheritance, and alimony.

In extreme cases, a native or someone important to him may die in the hospital or under mysterious circumstances.

They can either be idealistic in nature, or they can be strange and misleading.

It is very possible that the traditions and lifestyle that you have followed up to this point will exhaust themselves in the atmosphere of the current events of your life.

    <value>This period may be accompanied by internal contradictions that come to the fore during this period. You will not be able to clearly define your goals due to the lack of seriousness of your intentions or because they were initially generated by erroneous or unrealistic assumptions. The problems that face you, although they lead you to a dead end, nevertheless help to maintain your image and understand the nature and validity of your claims. During this period, your leadership position, ideals, and personal integrity may suffer or raise doubts. Illusions promote unrealistic ideas and unjustified hopes, which can lead to fanaticism, either on your part or on the part of others. Avoid using drugs, alcohol and other stimulants, but this aspect is negative in all respects. Sensitivity and spiritual consciousness, imagination and inspiration can grow.

The conjunction of the transiting Neptune with the natal Sun has basically the same significance as the conjunction of the transiting Sun with the natal Neptune, however, this conjunction lasts about two years longer due to the backward movement.

You will lack the ability to evaluate yourself and other people, and your ideals and expectations may turn out to be unrealistic.

The very likely disappointments and deceptions of this period will lead to failures in the field of joint ventures, artistic projects, legal processes and romantic adventures. Your talent and ability to appreciate art and beauty can be revealed in its entirety. The pursuit of physical pleasures, luxury, and wealth these days can become disastrous if you forget about prudence and moderation. Negative circumstances can cause the collapse of your entire value system, and positive circumstances can help you create a new, more orderly version of that system.

There will be malfunctions in the mechanism of cars and other means of transport, including boats, that no one will be able to identify and eliminate.

This period is extremely unfavorable for risky activities, since you hardly understand what you are up against.

In relation to your achievements, you tend to harbor unrealistic hopes, you tend to trust rude flattery or those who promise you more than they can give. The best thing is to be patient and philosophical. For example, you may not be able to get the job or recognition you seek, but you will have another acceptable job or recognized achievements for a while.

    <value> is characterized by the end of crystallized professional conditions and the beginning of new ones. Serious responsibilities may arise that require caution and maturity.

There is probably a feeling of an increased need for material security and a meaningful place in one's world. There is a desire to work for long-term goals and objectives, usually associated with career ambition. The increased ambition and supportive force associated with this transit make it possible to start long-term projects. The need to settle into a certain, established life routine on which to build future security can result in a more conservative outlook on life, especially regarding business, professional affairs, and politics. Transit can bring involvement in serious mathematical, scientific, business or political activities.

At this time, the results of past actions come up for evaluation and correction. Whether their consequences will serve for good or evil depends on the merits of these past deeds. If they were carried out responsibly and realistically, then a person is free to begin new important acts of life.

When this transit occurs between the ages of 27 and 29, it indicates the full acceptance of adult responsibilities and responsibilities. When he meets between the ages of 57 and 59, he marks the high point of his personal career.

    <value>Self-discipline and ambition reach their peak; hard work will pay off later. People are not in the mood for frivolity; there are too many things to do! Individual responsibility is the key. Now we are more focused than usual, manageable and ready to solve everyday tasks that we usually avoid. No one wants to waste energy, so almost everyone will commit to working hard and doing their job well.

Working alone is more effective than trying to work with others. Nevertheless, business meetings are good because we can formulate goals and formulate a plan and time frame to achieve them, step by step. The results of today's work will be practical, high-quality and durable. Serious consideration leads to deep awareness. Focus on staying grounded and aware. Today we may feel pessimistic or cynical, but we must not allow ourselves to look solely on the dark side.

The conjunction of the transiting Saturn with the natal Sun has the same significance as the conjunction of the transiting Sun with the natal Saturn. However, it carries a longer duration and is much more important for human development. The conjunction of the transiting Saturn with the Natal Sun occurs once every 29 years and marks the main line in the development of individual maturity. It also evokes everything that a person has earned through their past work and deeds — whatever the results, favorable or not, from the life experience that this transit brings. There is a valuable lesson to be learned from all this.</value>

    <value>Is characterized by increased responsibility towards friends, groups, and organizations. It is often possible to involve new methods and modern technologies in professional affairs.

Professional activity in one way or another is often associated with engineering, manual labor, or research and improvement, especially in the electronics industry. There may be concerns about the organizational management of the business and professional activities related to these areas.

There is often an increased motivation to achieve personal goals and objectives. There is an experience of either personal success or vicissitudes of fate, according to past actions and motivations. These consequences often arise through sudden and unexpected karmic circumstances.

This time is favorable for serious scientific or mathematical work, for the practical application of original ideas and intuitive inspirations.</value>

    <value>Communication will lack humor and lightheartedness, and even the most fleeting meetings will become serious, regardless of the desires of their participants. Relationships with women, partners, and allies, as well as the work of joint ventures, are particularly vulnerable during this period. Diplomatic and social contacts are unlikely to inspire you, and they will certainly serve selfish purposes. If pleasant moments are possible during this period, they will certainly be associated with new responsibilities. All of this looks pretty bleak overall, but there may be potentially positive circumstances. Orderly and serious relationships can mean increased stability and trust. Even if romantic and partnership offers lack flirtation and frivolity, there is no doubt about their seriousness.

A penchant for formality in manners and even in clothes will become commonplace. During this period, socializing will become exhausting, and if you are not one of those who lead a hectic social life, the circumstances of this period will make you completely forget about it. You will be attracted to those who are older and more experienced than you. Artistic aspirations will become more focused and organized, although originality and imagination will suffer due to the tendency to follow traditions, as well as apply methods and subjects with which you are familiar. This period is unfavorable for procedures related to appearance, for cosmetic operations and processes related to decoration.

    <value>Untimely actions, previous failures, government officials and insufficient generosity will hinder your personal growth, economic prosperity, spiritual self-realization and intellectual aspirations at this time. You will be required to sacrifice some of your prosperity or success to help others, but you will not be able to do so. This period is unfavorable for your father or any of your supervisors, and some problems may arise due to conflicts with them (whether your fault or theirs). You may break up with your father or have to take on his responsibilities. If, despite the potentially negative nature of this period, most situations are resolved without problems, you should not take your luck for granted or tempt fate by deliberately creating situations in which the circumstances described above will arise.

    <value>A serious lack of energy will slow down your progress. Circumstances may contribute to a lack of motivation to achieve any goals, or physical illness may prevent you from taking the necessary action. Perhaps it's not you, but those you rely on, who will experience a lack of enthusiasm or get sick. At this time, cars, other means of transport and other equipment will probably require repair or replacement. Obstacles to work and other physical efforts will be encountered at every step - this is a characteristic feature of this period.

Discontent, anger, resistance to the authorities, attempts to circumvent rules and regulations or avoid prohibitions will be a waste of time and effort. If you are anxious, you need to give a healthy outlet to your emotions - for example, exercise, because anger can reach a critical point and lead to violent actions. The pace of business will slow down significantly. Past and present irresponsibility can make things worse.

    <value>The current circumstances portend serious problems related to education, communication, travel or transportation. You will probably be deprived of the opportunity to freely rotate in your familiar surroundings at this time. Contacts and joint activities with brothers, sisters and neighbors will be limited and difficult. Technical, design, and computer projects or the development of your skills may fail. Any mechanical and other equipment that you use on a daily basis will require replacement or repair during this period, especially if it is old and has rarely been subjected to routine inspections. The pace of transactions, especially those related to sales, will slow down.

Your ideas and ways of expressing yourself will gain more rigor. Even if you manage to maintain a sense of humor and nonchalance, you will not be able to show them. If you have lacked organization, prudence, and attention to detail in the past, you are now fully capable of filling this gap. Incorrect timing and even minor delays can become a serious problem for you. Avoid anger and irritation, as they are useless and can only make things worse. Show patience and tolerance in everything, do not force events, avoid open confrontations in difficult situations that can be easily resolved at another time.

    <value>The circumstances of this period are characterized by a negative connotation. Perhaps the most successful comparison would be the current atmosphere with a barren environment devoid of feelings and optimism. Emotional hardships and losses may be related to the past. As a result of neglect, loneliness, or abuse, there will be a serious threat to close relationships, perhaps even a breakup. The most likely aspects of this destructive atmosphere surrounding you will be family relationships, home environment, and creative projects. For example, there may be a break with the mother or her estrangement, as well as difficulties associated with children. During this period, your home can hardly be considered the happiest place for you. Family responsibilities will become a debilitating burden.

    <value>This transit calls for realistic cooperation and awareness. Paranoia or avoidance of responsibility can also be caused by personal unfitness and fear of defeat. To maintain psychological balance, absolute honesty and a practical approach to responsibility are necessary, combined with attempts at an optimistic attitude.

Abuse of drugs, alcohol, or mental techniques can also lead to mental imbalance and create a threat of control from undesirable mental influences.

The period is unfavorable for dealing with hospitals, orphanages and similar institutions, as well as with religious and cultural institutions.

In some cases, there may be illegal practices and dishonesty in business and professional pursuits. Public disclosures of past secret dealings can lead to a loss of position, status, and reputation.</value>

There is a need to deal with oppressive authoritarian personalities, business, political or economic organizations. People with an evil and sinister character should be avoided at all costs, as they can involve them in dangerous illegal activities.

Fear or danger from occult activities may also be a problem. The abuse of occult power or economic power and authority for personal self-aggrandizement can have devastating, long-lasting consequences.

    <value>If you agree to forget about your goals, your personality, and maybe even your pride for a while, you will get through this period safely. Past failures in fulfilling your promises or taking responsibility will begin to haunt you again. Expect opposition from the authorities. All sorts of rules and regulations, endless delays and other annoying annoyances are a feature of this period. Your leadership skills, integrity, honesty, and generosity will be challenged by those who are older or in a higher position. Vitality and willpower will either be lacking, or they will prove ineffective in overcoming the current circumstances. Success and other rewards are unlikely to make you feel satisfied. If you break the rules or try to get your way at any cost, you will lose something more valuable. Overwork and stress can pose a serious health problem.

Among the conflicts of the old and the new that are characteristic of this transit, there is also a conflict between people with established authority and personal revolutionary sentiments, a conflict between new and old methods of doing business or professional affairs, and the expansion of these conflicts into friendship and association with IT companies and organizations. Responsibility in a marriage, partnership, or other important relationship can limit personal freedom.

There may also be an increased sense of responsibility towards friends, IT companies and organizations to which the native belongs, as well as the need to cooperate with them. Ideas about business, professional, and political affairs can be eccentric and unpractical. Unexpected difficulties may arise in professional affairs and business.

The native or those associated with him may have base motives, such as the benefit of status or professional advancement, hoping to succeed through friends, groups or associates in what they cannot achieve themselves. This can naturally lead to alienation. If the motives of a native are selfish, then he may be exposed to sudden vicissitudes of fate, such as the loss of a job or professional position.

This is an unfavorable period for dealing with corporate and pooled money, insurance, taxes, or the deceased's estate. Lawsuits and financial difficulties related to these issues are possible.

In this astrological situation, you and those with whom you have to communicate are not inclined to compromise, because the opportunity for them has long been missed. No matter how the situation develops, you are unlikely to look particularly attractive or radiate charm. It may seem that everyone around has lost their sense of humor. Events that promise to be pleasant don't live up to expectations. The pursuit of beauty, luxury, cooperation and harmony will either fail, or its result will be extremely meager. Romantic hobbies will be complicated by anger, annoyance, lack of enthusiasm and opportunities, or a combination of all these reasons. Social activities will lose their appeal and may cease altogether. By choice or by circumstances, you will work and spend time alone: this prospect is not so bleak, because thanks to it you will be able to carry out some plans. The most positive way to deal with potentially negative situations is to switch to something else.
